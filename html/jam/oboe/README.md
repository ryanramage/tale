**Oboe.js** helps web applications respond quicker by wrapping http's request-response model
with a progressively streamed interface.
It glues a transport that sits 
**somewhere between streaming and downloading** to a **JSON parser that sits somewhere between SAX and
DOM**. It is small enough to be a [micro-library](http://microjs.com/#), doesn't have any external dependencies and 
doesn't care which other libraries you need it to speak to.

Oboe makes it really easy to start using json from a response before the ajax request completes. 
Or even if it never completes.
